The page shows Playerunknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) player statistics. It
is a battle royale shooter game where the last one alive wins. In the game
Up to 100 players on the map participate. They take place every year around the world
e-sports championships where the world's best players meet

To check a player's statistics:

1. Choose a gaming platform
2. Enter the player's name - case is important because there are over 50 players
   million, e.g. TGLTN (youtuber)
3. Select a season - the default is set to lifetime where you can see the results since
   the beginning of his career
4. Statistics from various game modes are available in FPP and TPP view
5. The 'Rank Stats' option is a game mode where you gain a player's rank - the medal changes
   increases as your rank increases. Here the results are only available after selection
   specific season after pressing the 'Ranks Stats' button. There is no rank
   lifetime for this option.
6. Statistics are updated approximately 15 minutes after the last game


API

API limitations were the biggest challenge when building the application. The API initially only allowed 10 requests per MINUTE. Recently, after publishing the application on the website, the game producers granted me faster access (100 RPM), so the application is being further developed and it will be possible to track the results of the last 20 matches
